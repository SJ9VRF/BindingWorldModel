# Binding World Model
MultiModal Binding for World Modeling

![Screenshot_2025-01-08_at_7 36 50_AM-removebg-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b0dbb8-8ffb-4a25-87d5-37d6025cecf8)


The BindingWorldModel approach integrates multimodal data to construct coherent world models by leveraging cross-modal attention mechanisms and latent-space alignment. Using contrastive transformer-based architectures, it binds visual, textual, and sensor data into unified latent representations,  enhancing physical intelligence, perception, and interaction. 


## Modular Progressive Training Process for Multimodal Binding

- **Contrastive Learning**: Align embeddings of semantically similar data points (e.g., a text description and its corresponding image) while pushing apart unrelated ones.
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Retrieve data from one modality using queries from another modality (e.g., retrieve images given text or retrieve audio given video).

### 1. Process Overview
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create modality-specific encoders (e.g., BERT for text, ResNet for images, Wav2Vec2 for audio).
   - Use a **shared embedding space** (e.g., 512-dimensional vector) to align all modalities.

2. **Progressive Training**:
   - Start with **simpler modality pairs** (e.g., `text-image`).
   - Gradually add **more complex pairs** (e.g., `video-touch`, `action-point_cloud`).

3. **Contrastive Loss**:
   - Minimize the distance between embeddings of semantically related data (e.g., a text and its corresponding image).
   - Maximize the distance between embeddings of unrelated data.

4. **Cross-Modal Retrieval**:
   - Test whether embeddings from one modality can retrieve relevant data from another modality.
